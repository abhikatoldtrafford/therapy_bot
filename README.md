  - Custom: Upload your own PDFs/DOCX/TXT to override default knowledge base

## 🎯 Usage

### 1. Basic Therapy Session

1. Launch the app and fill in the session form:
   - Name and email
   - Today's focus
   - Desired outcomes
   - Current challenges

2. Start chatting via:
   - Text input
   - Voice recording (🎙️ button)
   - Image upload (sidebar)

3. Enable "📢Talk" mode for automatic voice responses

### 2. Knowledge Base

The system comes with a comprehensive NARM therapy knowledge base:

**Default Vector Store** (`vs_68d4f901de948191bf47c56de33994e8`):
- **NARM.pdf**: Complete NARM therapy principles and techniques
- **Working-with-Developmental-Trauma.pdf**: Developmental trauma treatment approaches
- Automatically loaded for all sessions
- Contains therapeutic frameworks, case studies, and clinical examples

**Custom Knowledge Base**:
- Upload your own PDFs, DOCX, or TXT files during setup
- Creates a new vector store specific to your session
- Overrides the default knowledge base
- Perfect for specialized therapy approaches or domain-specific content

### 3. Advanced Configuration

Click "⚙️ Advanced Configuration" during setup to:

- **Upload Custom Knowledge Base**: Add domain-specific documents
- **AI Prompt Builder**: Describe your ideal assistant and let AI generate the prompt
- **Voice Settings**: Choose from 11 voices and customize behavior

### 3. Modular System

Run the configuration wizard:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This provides a 6-step wizard to configure:
1. API credentials
2. Assistant settings
3. TTS preferences
4. STT configuration
5. UI features
6. Advanced options

### 4. Testing Individual Modules

Each module has a standalone UI for testing:
```bash
# Test Speech-to-Text
cd modules/stt_service && streamlit run main.py

# Test Text-to-Speech
cd modules/tts_service && streamlit run main.py

# Test other modules similarly...
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Model Configuration

Edit `backend.py` to adjust models:
```python
MODEL_NAME = "gpt-5-mini"           # Main chat model (falls back to gpt-4o for Assistants)
TTS_MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini-tts"       # Advanced TTS with voice instructions
TTS_STANDARD_MODEL = "tts-1"        # Standard TTS fallback
STT_MODEL = "gpt-4o-transcribe"     # Accurate transcription with streaming
STT_MINI_MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini-transcribe"  # Fast transcription with streaming
STT_LEGACY_MODEL = "whisper-1"      # Legacy fallback
POLLING_INTERVAL = 0.3               # Reduced from 2s for 85% faster responses
DEFAULT_VECTOR_STORE = "vs_68d4f901de948191bf47c56de33994e8"  # NARM knowledge base
```

### Voice Instructions (NEW)

Customize voice behavior using gpt-4o-mini-tts instructions parameter:
```python
TTS_VOICE_INSTRUCTIONS = """Speak with warmth and therapeutic presence. Use natural pauses
for emphasis. Maintain an empathetic, supportive tone. Speak slowly and clearly when
discussing emotional content. Use gentle inflection to convey understanding."""
```

This feature is unique to the gpt-4o-mini-tts model and allows fine-grained control over voice delivery.

### Enhanced NARM Framework Implementation

The system implements a comprehensive 150+ line NARM therapeutic framework with detailed coverage of all 5 organizing principles:

1. **Connection** (0-6 months): Right to exist and be present
   - Addresses: Dissociation, disconnection from body, chronic health issues
   - Focus: Grounding, safety, embodiment exercises

2. **Attunement** (0-2 years): Right to have needs met
   - Addresses: Difficulty identifying needs, emotional dysregulation
   - Focus: Emotional awareness, need recognition, self-soothing

3. **Trust** (8 months-2 years): Right to healthy interdependence
   - Addresses: Difficulty trusting others, betrayal trauma
   - Focus: Building trust gradually, healthy boundaries

4. **Autonomy** (2-3 years): Right to say no and set boundaries
   - Addresses: Difficulty asserting self, people-pleasing patterns
   - Focus: Assertiveness, authentic expression, saying no

5. **Love/Sexuality** (3+ years): Right to love with open heart
   - Addresses: Intimacy fears, vulnerability challenges
   - Focus: Heart-opening, authentic connection, healthy sexuality

Each principle includes specific therapeutic interventions, somatic awareness practices, and integration techniques.
